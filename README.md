## FoodApp

**Description:**

This project was built back on the year of the 2015 in conjunction with old partners and friends (Leandro Hagen and Lucas Tomazi, all credits to them too!!!). This project aims a store of frozen food here at the southern part of Brazil. It was our first project written in a native way for iOS, using the Swift initial versions. I think it’s interesting to save here as a portfolio and to show how we wrote this code a few years ago (:|) 

**Technologies:**

We have used a few old technologies (I don't know if they still exist) to bring-up this app alive. The major ones are:

- CocoaPods for managing the project dependencies;
- Alamofire: HTTP API for reaching the backend API;
- CoreData: to build all the data layer of the app;
- Fabric (old crashlytics): to collect/monitor production crashs;
- Eureka: form build helper;

**Screens:**

There are a bunch of screens in this app like login, check-in, check-out, bookmarks and others. The ideia of the project was to order the frozen food and do the payment in a 'live way' (yeh, we didn’t use IAP or any other payment gateway). The project interacted with a third party backend using the Alamofire library.

**Notes:**

- This project **definitely is not building**, it’s just a legacy project and it’s not running anymore, never was actually;
- Some assets and internal names inside the source code were removed or replaced due license and preservation;
